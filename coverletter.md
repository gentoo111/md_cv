Dear Hiring Manager,

### Subject: Application for Software Developer Position

I am in search of an opportunity that fully leverages my backend development skills in Java and Python, as well as my proficiency with frontend frameworks such as Node.js, AngularJS, and Vue. Upon discovering the recruitment services offered by Sourced NZ, I was excited about the prospect of finding a position that aligns with my professional skills and career aspirations through your esteemed agency.

I am currently pursuing a Master of Applied Computing degree at Lincoln University and am about to begin my internship, with an expected graduation date of November this year. During this period, I can dedicate 20 hours per week to work. My professional background includes system architecture design, technical architecture optimization, product technology selection, interface specification formulation, and leading technical challenges and development teams. I have previously served as a Senior Java Software Engineer at AIER EYE, where I was responsible for the core business development of the hospital information system and have been honored as a CSDN blog expert, in addition to publishing multiple original technical articles.

I have a keen interest in software deployment, backend and frontend development, database management, middleware solutions, and operating systems. I am confident that these experiences and skills make me an ideal candidate for Sourced NZ. I am passionate about working in a diverse team and look forward to contributing my expertise and enthusiasm to help your clients tackle complex technical issues.

I am very much looking forward to the opportunity to discuss in detail how I can provide value to Sourced NZ's clients. Please refer to my attached resume for more information on my educational background and professional experience.
